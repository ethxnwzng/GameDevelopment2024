1. The gameplay concept
    -My game (unamed at the moment) will be a fast paced, bouncy, 2d platformer shooter set in a galaxy with planets filled with delicious melons that your character must scavenge for across the cosmos.
    -Players will go through each of these planets with their respective unique aesthetics and obstacles, trying to get capture all the melons from these planets without dying from the planet's dangers.
   
2.Personal priorities
    -I would like to be able to confidently say that I understand most of the core concepts associated with using Unity (specifically from a 2D-developement lens)
    -I would like to satisfy my enviosenment for the final product of the game. As someone who has played video games all their life, I would like to think that I have a good judgement for what feels, looks, and is fun for video games. Therefore, fulfilling what I envision for my game would be a great accomplihsment and give me confidence that I can bring my ideas out in both a creative and CS way.
    -I would also like to see if I can implenent my own animations (particulary for the character being played within the game)
    
3. The core mechanics 
    -Movement (character is in space, so want to give a bouncy, high jumping, long-airtime gameplay, but need to refine character interactions with terrain in the game to be smoother)
    -Attacking -> I want the attack system to be similar to Cuphead (specifically the pea shooter), where the character can move and jump around while still firing a ranged high-speed attack
    -The world -> Need more ideas and asset packs for planets and different backdrops I can create to make the game feel fresh and non-repetitive.
    -Obstalces -> Need more ideas and asset packs for obstacles so players can always have new mechanics to learn and overcome.
   
5. Nice-to-haves 
     -Kind of covered above, maybe also a cool soundtrack to add as I already have sounds for events in the game (getting hit, collecting objects, etc)
   
5. Rough Timeline (you aren't obligated to stick to this, but try to plan out what things you'll work on and when)
      -March 14: Finish Level 2
      -March 21: Find new aesthetics and obstacles and get at least half of it implemented into Level 3
      -After Easter break: Should have all 3 levels working perfefctly with no bugs in movement or combat.
