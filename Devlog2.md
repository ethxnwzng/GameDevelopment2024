Core systems of Hades include: weapons, power ups (specifically the categories they can fall in due to), levels as well as the ability of the player to choose what reward they will receive from the level, the upgrade system with the purple magic, and of course the enemies (probably missing some). If I were leading the creation of Hades, I would personallly choose to work on the movement and figthing systems in the game first. I feel like a big part of Hades is its' hash and slashy satisfying combat, killing things have to look, sound, and just feel good for gauntlet fighting games like those. Similar to the previous point, I believe the selling point of Hades is its' combat. It's super smooth and impactful, I really feel the damage that my abiliites and attacks are doing against my opponents. To me, I feel that just the linear dungeon structure of the game takes away from some of the fun of the game, becauese although there is some surprises in what lies in the next dungeon (new mobs, bosses, rewards, etc), I kind of just got drowned out after playing for a while due to having the same goal in mind (pass the level).
